# REDCap_mock_protocol
REDCap mock protocol: An observational study of functional outcomes following falls in older adults in an aged care facility

### Intended output
This mock study protocol is intended to demonstrate REDCap ready study design and data capture planning, aligned to ICH- GCP principles using a structured data dictionary. 

# 1. Study objectives
Primary: describe functional outcomes at 30 days following a documented fall in older adults  
Secondary: describe the proportion of participants experiencing re- falls or hospitalisation within 30 days  

# 2. Study design 
This is a single- site, observational, longitudinal study using routinely collected clinical information. There will be no intervention delivered, no randomisation or blinding. Data will be collected at baseline and follow up time points. 

# 3. Study population 
Inclusion criteria:  
* Adults aged 65 and over
* Documented falls within the past 7 days
* An active resident in facility

Exclusion criteria: 
* Falls resulting in end of life care

# 4. Study timeline and events 
Participants will be followed across 3 time points: 
* Baseline: within 7 days of fall
* Follow up: 30 days post fall
* Follow up 2: 60 days post fall (if resident is still in the facility)

# 5. Data collection overview 
## Data instruments 
* Patient demographics
* Fall event details
* Injury details
* Functional assessment (DEMI score) 
* Follow up outcomes

# 6. Data quality and validation 
* Mandatory fields will be applied to critical variables
* Conditional and branching logic checks will ensure data consistency
* Range checks will be used for numerical fields

# 7. Data management and security 
* All residents are de- identified and entered with unique resident ids
* Data is stored in a secure electronic data capture system and accessible only to authorised personnel ( investigator and sponsors)

# 8. Ethical considerations 
This mock protocol is designed for training and demonstration purposes only and does not involve real participant recruitment. In a real study, ethics approval will be obtained from IRB prior to data collection.
